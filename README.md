## **Our Idea:**
Our idea for our project is to create a portfolio website that shows off custom contents we made for several video games (Such as skins, modes, and levels). Each custom content will be accompanied with pictures (with videos if applicable) and development history.

## **Front end:**
Main pages include home, gallery, about us and contact info.

## **Back end:**
Node.js

##  **Features:**
● Horizontal scrollable flexboxes with clickable thumbnails of our items.

● Dedicated page for each of our items, which can be accessed via clicking on the thumbnails in flexbox.

● On the dedicated page of each item, there will be pictures and/or videos of said item,
with the development history of said item being next to the pictures in the form of text. There will also be a download link if said item is publicly available.

● Instead of a plain color or static picture as the background of each item’s dedicated page, we will be implementing an animated background showing the item in action.

● Allow users to post comments at the bottom of each item. Both with and without an account (as guest). We will be using comment API such as Disqus.

## **Minimal Viable Product Features:**
● Colored head, footer, and background for both main page and item pages.

● The main page will have the website’s title, under the title is a short description of what the website is showcasing.

● Still on the main page, below both title and description are square thumbnails of items we want to showcase. They are clickable and direct visitors to each item’s page.

● Each item’s page will have pictures and descriptions associated with said item. If the item is publicly available, a hyperlink to the item’s download page will be added to the end of the item’s description.

● The head of every page will have the following: Home (Take visitor back to main page), About Us (Send visitor to a dedicated page with every site creators’ name listed and a short paragraph stating the purpose and history of the website), and Contact (Listing each site creator’s contact information).

● The footer will contain hyperlinks to Home and About Us, website copyright, and contact information (such as email).

##   **Stretch goals:**
● The background of each item’s page will be a video or GIF showing the item in action
(Similar to Valve’s website as seen here:  ([https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/](https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/) )rather than a plain color.

● The thumbnails on the main page will have slight zoom animation and thumbnail brightness change when the mouse hovers above them.

● Implement comment API, which allows users to post comments with or without an account at the bottom of each item’s page. (Emojis, pictures, and GIFs are also allowed)
